# Project Almanac: Steganography

Final assignment for Digital Image Processing. The final code can be found in this git repository or [here](code.py)
## 1. Introduction

With this project we're trying to learn more about steganography and it's use with audios. We're going to hide a movie audio in it's poster image, merging the two and then extracting the audio later. 
  
Unlike encryption, that conceals the data by scrambling information, steganography hides the important data in another file, that doesn't appear to be anormal.
  
As we like very much movies and soundtracks, we chose this theme for our project.
  
## 2. The Method
 
We're going to use the MSB Substitution method to hide the audio. It basically replaces the most significant bit in some bytes of the colored image with some data of the audio. As we use colored image in the RGB color channel, the work is done within the 3 sets of 8 bits for each pixel, each byte representing red, green and blue. If we change just a few bits in each pixel (inserting the audio data), the image will stay almost the same to the human eye.
 
 
### Hiding process:
 
The libraries we use are __imageio__ and __matplotlib__ to read the images and make some adjustments, __numpy__ to use arrays and matrices for the algorithm part, __AudioSegment__ from __pydub__ and __wave__ to deal with the audio in _.mp3_ and _.wav_ formats

To begin, we read the movie poster image

Then the audio. Note that we open the audio (wich is a _.mp3_ file) and convert it to a _.wav_, because .......

To prepare for the insertion in the image, we transform the _.wav_ file into an array of bytes, so we can manipulate then easier


 
 

 First we need to read the cover image;
 Convert the audio file into a sequence of bits;
 Insert the bits of the audio into each pixel of the image;
 Form the stego-image;


### 4Retrieving the audio:


 Read the stego-image; 
 Check the pixel bits with the MSB algorithm and find the bits of the audio;
 Reconstruct the audio;
